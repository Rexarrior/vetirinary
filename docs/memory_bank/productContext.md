# Product Context: Veterinary Clinic Website

## Why this project exists
Small veterinary clinics need a simple, effective way to communicate with pet owners, share news, and provide contact information. This project provides a template/foundation for such a website.

## How it works
- **Content Management**: The clinic staff can use the Django Admin panel to update news, veterinarian profiles, and clinic information without touching code.
- **User Interaction**: Visitors can read news, learn about the clinic, find it on a map, and send messages through a contact form.
- **AI Assistance**: (Planned) An AI chatbot will help answer common questions.
- **AI Administration**: (Planned) An autonomous agent to manage database records and generate reports based on user requests.

## User Experience Goals
- **Informative**: Clear information about services and staff.
- **Accessible**: Easy to find contact details and location.
- **Trustworthy**: Professional design and up-to-date news.
