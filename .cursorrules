# Agent Rules & Guidelines

## Memory Bank Protocol
- **CRITICAL**: Before starting any task, you MUST read all files in the `docs/memory_bank/` directory. This ensures you have the full context of the project's goals, architecture, and current state.
- **Maintenance**: After completing a significant task or change, you MUST update the relevant files in the Memory Bank (especially `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`) to reflect the new state of the project.

## General Principles
- **Context First**: Always prioritize understanding the existing codebase and documentation before suggesting or implementing changes.
- **Rich Aesthetics**: When working on frontend tasks, ensure the design is modern, premium, and visually stunning (as per system instructions).
- **Semantic HTML**: Always use semantic HTML5 elements and follow SEO best practices.
- **Clean Code**: Follow PEP 8 for Python/Django and modern best practices for JavaScript and CSS.
- **Documentation**: Keep the documentation (especially in `docs/`) in sync with the implementation.
